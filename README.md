✔ About Me

I am in a perpetual Beta mode, a "wannabe" Geek, a Social Media and Communication addict.

Also, a recruitment and sourcing specialist, having around 7 years of enriched experience in hiring Mechanical, IT & Non-IT professionals across the globe. I am a Portal & Social Media sourcing expert currently hiring for diversified roles in and around different cities of Europe & APJ.

I do have proven experience in recruiting IT talent, availing of job boards and vendor sourcing partnerships with top Startups, Midsize Product Organizations, Multibillion Conglomerates.

I handle the recruitment cycle for Middle, Senior and Top Management levels.

✔ What do I do?

I convert People to Candidates which means I work with internal recruiters and on their behalf, I identify, contact and engage with highly qualified professionals. My goal is to understand these people’s motivations and just propose them to be introduced to the recruiter/HR person. Mainly for hard-to-fill positions.
